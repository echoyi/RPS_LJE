0,Original training sample,2619,1,"Wow , this was another good spin off of the original American pie , not as good as band camp , but definitely a lot better the naked mile . Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this one , but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile . The script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly , however most of the comedy came from sex , but that 's okay because that 's why we watch these movies anyway right ? < br /><br />The midget Rock also had a really good cameo , considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile , his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it.<br /><br />The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile , if you liked any previous American Pie films , you should like beta house , unless you view all of the American pie spin - offs a waste of money ."

3,RPS-$l_2$,14701,1,"This is a very memorable spaghetti western . It has a great storyline , interesting characters , and some very good acting , especially from Rosalba Neri . Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic . She steals every scene she is in , and expresses so much with her face and eyes , even when she 's not speaking . Her performance is very believable . She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there 's anything wrong with being over the top ) . Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent , and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie , whether you want it to or not . There are a couple of parts that are very amusing . I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot . There 's also lots of slick gun - play that 's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was n't for two things . The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film . This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie . It is very poorly choreographed , and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight . One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy , but this is a more serious western , and the brawl really needed to be more realistic . The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma 's cowardly Mexican sidekick . I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something , but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this , and he was n't at all funny . All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him ? < br /><br />All that having been said , let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned , and all fans of the genre need to see this movie ."
