0,Original training sample,4789,1,"Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen , although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi - Laturi . Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold , a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia . But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time . In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries , such as Estonia , became independent . Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries . But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance . ( And many of them still do ... at least on some level ... ) < br /><br />Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well - written script . The actors are also very good , especially Jüri Järvet ( perhaps the best known Estonian actor , plays Snaut in Tarkovski 's Solaris ) , playing and old gangster who 's slowly becoming tired of his way of life . But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger , a child - actor playing Terje , a boyish girl in her early teens , whose presence in the plot is quite essential . ( and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb - credit list!!!)w < br /><br />There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time . But Tallinn Pimeduses does that . Unfortenately Järvi - Laturi 's other films are far from this kind of achievements . His first one , Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest , History is Made at Night was just a weird mess ."

3,RPS-$l_2$,14701,1,"This is a very memorable spaghetti western . It has a great storyline , interesting characters , and some very good acting , especially from Rosalba Neri . Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic . She steals every scene she is in , and expresses so much with her face and eyes , even when she 's not speaking . Her performance is very believable . She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there 's anything wrong with being over the top ) . Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent , and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie , whether you want it to or not . There are a couple of parts that are very amusing . I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot . There 's also lots of slick gun - play that 's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was n't for two things . The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film . This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie . It is very poorly choreographed , and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight . One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy , but this is a more serious western , and the brawl really needed to be more realistic . The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma 's cowardly Mexican sidekick . I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something , but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this , and he was n't at all funny . All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him ? < br /><br />All that having been said , let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned , and all fans of the genre need to see this movie ."
